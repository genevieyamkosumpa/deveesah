                            <p> Hey just resumed my CBS All Access to watch this seasons CBB, but I keep getting this message on the screen: My adblocker is disabled Anyone know how to fix? Thanks. 
Has anyone found an adblocker for Microsoft edge? That's the only reason that I don't want to leave chrome Hi folks, This one has been happening for a bit, but now has become an issue for me. This is a great example of the issue: Try to enter a question at answers.microsoft.com: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/newthread?threadtype=Questionsampcancelurl=%2Fen-us%3Fauth%3D1 Look below the text box and there is a spinning wheel that never stops while it waits for something to load. ( I suspect form or form controls) No way to enter the question. Submit does nothing. https://www.in4m8n.com/a. Hallo erstmal Seit den letzten Tagen gibt es auf PietSmiet.de einen neuen Videoplayer der mit der Begründung gt "Leider mussten wir innerhalb kürzester Zeit den Player wechseln . " eingesetzt wird und ihm natürlich noch Features fehlen. Aber durch den neuen Player ist es mir nicht mehr möglich per Chrome oder auch Edge Videos auf der Seite zugucken. Ich nutze sehr oft und gerne die Pietsmiet Seite, doch mit dem neuen Update kommt ich nicht über das Intro hinaus. _Making the most out of MacOS Mojave_  Since friends and family have been asking me about setting up their new Macs, I figured I’d compile some of the stuff that I do/like/use for anybody wandering in from a Google search, or just from /r/all. I spend a lot of time using my Mac, so I hunt down lots of little things.  1. Browsing: The bulk of my peers spend their computer time browsing the web and consuming media. It’s great that we have lots of options in terms of maximizing batte. I finally updated Google Chrome yesterday. After doing so, it immediately went bonkers. Adblockers started giving me scam ads that were unskippable (I had to remove the extension) and in certain platforms, I simply cannot watch any videos. While the audio plays, the "frame" in which the video is being played just gets glitchy and shows whatever is on another window in the background or what was in the screen before clicking the video. If I scroll, it does that glitch drag effect Don't want to go into too much detail, but I think it is worth sharing with you. I was kicked out of a competitive MM match because some program was interfering with the VAC detection of CS:GO. I am not a cheater and I was baffled. I was offered a link in which I was told to verify my game files and uninstall any software that may interfere with the game. I did just that and just in case, I let my anti virus program run an extra intensive scan. 1 1/2 hours later Whats your thoughts on it? I gave it an honest go. Dropped Google, installed Microsoft Launcher, OneDrive, Office Suite, even Edge. Synced over Drive files to OneDrive, and let the trial begin. Pretty surprised after a month of using it. All the apps work well, even Edge is smooth and it's adblocker works, tab syncing to the PC works. Haven't had any show stopping issues with OneDrive (occasionally a connection issue). Their To-Do app is well designed and handy. It's beyond Google's 
Here is the method I use to keep an ad free environment on KissAnime without even needing an account to disable specific types of ads. I mainly use Microsoft Edge so the extension links are directed to there. However all these extensions are available on most other browsers. So this can be used with any browser. I hope this helps a lot of people. Of course you can first try these methods listed here (https://www.reddit.com/r/KissAnime/comments/8yyfnc/a_comprehensive_guide_to_successfully_b. I finally got my Pi\-Hole \(RPi3b\) working. I uninstalled ublock origin on Microsoft Edge, restarted and browsed to some of the test sites. No ads! ampnbsp; So, this is a stupid question, do I need not run browser adblockers anymore? What about other security/privacy add\-ons like: Ghostery, Privacy Badger or Disconnect.me.

This is the best tl;dr I could make, original (https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/25/17500318/microsoft-edge-android-ad-blocker-built-in) reduced by 33%. (I'm a bot) gt Microsoft is building Adblock Plus directly into its Edge browser for iOS and Android. gt The software giant has started making the integration available to Microsoft Edge for Android beta users over the weekend, alongside an iOS test program. gt The feature will be rolled out more broadly https://aka.ms/qonos Hello Windows Insiders! Today, we are releasing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17618 (RS5) to Windows Insiders who have opted into Skip Ahead. What’s new in Build 17618 Sets: Sets is designed to make sure that everything related to your task: relevant webpages, research documents, necessary files, and applications, is connected and available to you in one click. Starting today in RS5 builds, we have turned the Sets experiment back on so any Insider who has opted I'm a longtime lurker in this subreddit (and reddit in general). I've noticed some people having similar issues that I've had in the past so I decided I should make a ridiculously long post explaining everything that I've learned while using the SP1, SP3 and now SP4. First of all make sure you have installed all the windows updates as some of these things are quite recent additions. ## Pen Tweaks There are a couple of simple things you should do to greatly improve your experience 
Got the dock setup at my desk. Left my Surface at home. Attempting to use nothing but Continuum and whatever tools at my disposal through it to work for one full day. Wish me luck. I hope I don't have to resort to a spare junker laptop :-) Obviously this is just a test to see how far I can take it. Update 1: The First Hour (Edit: Forgot to mention a wonky thing with TeamViewer) ----------------------------- - Discovered there's no working Remote Desktop app for Continuum (yet). Tried. For smoother performance, avoid from installing desktop apps seriously until you are forced too. Seriously. This is windows, more software have you installed, if not maintain properly, it will slow your pc down. In additon, desktop app installer also tend to include another unwanted software if you do not be careful like search bar, ad etc. So, as surface pro 3 user, I have a very fast and smooth operation in my PC especially with the newly launched Creators update. Heres my recommendation. On web video players like Streamango, OpenLoad and similar ones, Microsoft Edge isn't capable of showing embedded subtitles. On Chrome and Firefox, it works absolutely fine (i tried both with and without adblocker). Anyone else can confirm this, before i post it to Feedback. 
Having the same issues as others with the blank chat box across multiple browsers in different configs: Windows10: Google Chrome with extensions enabled and disabled, and incognito Microsoft Edge Android: Opera Mobile with and without adblocker A bit frustrating since I'm in the middle of a conversation with another user :P Posting this thread from my desktop on my main browser. - Night mode: false - RES Version: 5.8.6 - Browser: Chrome - Browser Version: 62 - Cookies Enabled: # Phishing is happening every day. Don't be the next victim. ##### Who's getting targeted (spoiler: it's everyone) What we are experiencing in the cryptospace is not new. Apple / Google Docs / Skype / Facebook / Paypal have all been used as lures for phishing attacks. You may get a purported charge email from Paypal.

Hi guys, my laptop went in for some pretty minor repairs last week on the mousepad, and when I got it back it not only seemed a bit slower (probably my imagination), there seems to be some malware on the computer that means every https site tries to run a script which launches some dodgy websites, and my adblock was no longer working completely, there were a few dodgy looking "You won't believe what happened!" type ads that it had missed. Another issue with it is that clicking anywhere on websi. </p>
