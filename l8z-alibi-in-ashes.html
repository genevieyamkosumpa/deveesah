I had a conversation with a character and the notebook updated to be like "XX is the culprit! Catch them!" I was like wut? The whole game was out of order from beginning to end.

So, I've started a few stories as responses to a prompt meme challenge where two characters from (usually) two different fandoms become pen pals for whatever reason.

Ten out of thirty-two of the core series plus the two dossiers are still left. Almost all of them are of the newer games. Interestingly enough, SEA is sold out.
