                            <p> DhkvNHssK2 What I get from this random string (I love entropy): D (death) hk (honorkill) v (forcible (vampire: willcontrol). New Hampshire (numberplates; live free or die) and ssk2 (sounds like SSH when thinking in Danish and 2 = healthy direction). To me; Is it acceptable to force people to do honorkills (like Japanese) via SSH tunnels on empathic levels? Here I think "Live free or die" applies. Do you think antivira can be activated to destroy a system from within? Much like making While browsing pictures of Laurent Gbagbo, a Google Images result directly brought me to this site: (Warning: Evil!) I've seen fake virus scanners before, but I was quite impressed by how well it's made. I know that curiosity killed the cat, but I was kind of intrigued where this would lead people who are fooled. I have Windows 7 64 and Security Essentials, both with the latest updates. So I downloaded BestAntivirus2011.exe and scanned it. No resul. Hi, i need help with a problem that occurs to a friend of mine. Usually we play matchmaking on official servers, where his ping is around 70-90 (he has not the best internet connection). Lately we thought it would be a good idea to get into FaceIt to practice some strats etc. But everytime he joins one of these servers (and also every community server listed in csgo) his ping instantly skyrockets to 900. We tried setting different tickrates, reinstalling, etc. Anyone has a clue what is causing. ESET? Antivira? Sohpos? Bitdefender? I know there are options. As I submit this I'm simultaneously looking for a respectable source for benchmarks and tests. Obviously the top factors are performance impact and efficacy. AV software is useless if it doesn't anti viruses. And it's a nuisance if it McAfees a system. Edit : So far it looks like webroot vs Bitdefender? Still reading. So after i finally got my game to patch via my phone i am now greeted with this error message upon starting the game. "black desert 64 exe stopped working". So far i've tried: 1. restarting pc 2. repairing bdo 3. disabling firewall 4. disabling antivira Nothing has worked so far. Anyone has any other good suggestions? Graphics drivers are up to date, never had this problem so far but as player for over a year i gotta say.they should rename this game to "Try to get your game to start Online". Has anyone had issues with this? I see multiple possible solutions when I do a search for it through Google however nothing definitive. It has persisted through any variation of Resmod, glidewrapper, new install, disabling antiviras, disabling windows autoupdate, downloaded a new "lite" desktop background, etc. Anyone have this issue and unfuck it? edit: For example: I will be running cows, and I will experience teleport lag, it is not "snappy" and then the cows will walk in place before explo. 
Hi all, I've been experiencing problems with my PC and am lost on what to do; hopefully you guys at /r/techsupport can help me out! Album with screenshots: Last year I built my own PC, installed Windows 10, an SSD and HDD and it worked great. Until like 2 months back, when it wouldn't install a new Windows 10 update. I tried many thing but it just wouldn't do it. Every time I'd shut down the PC, it would try to install updates, and whenever I turned it back on again Hi all, I've been experiencing problems with my PC and am lost on what to do; hopefully you guys at /r/computerhelp can help me out! Album with screenshots: Last year I built my own PC, installed Windows 10, an SSD and HDD and it worked great. Until like 2 months back, when it wouldn't install a new Windows 10 update. I tried many thing but it just wouldn't do it. Every time I'd shut down the PC, it would try to install updates, and whenever I turned it back on again. I'm pretty lost. The only thing I can think was that I was trying to download Winrar and, being the computer genius that I am (/s) I could have done it wrong or something. Recently, found three google chromes runnin using 40%. Tried to get a screen shot but they shot back down and disappeared. I will try to catch it next time. Thank you so much in advance if you read and respond. Any advice or feedback is welcome. Also, My computer is fairly new, I try to be careful :( I'm using the standar. So, I once stumpled upon a website which sole purpose where to make life easier for the people who just got a new computer, or just formatted their system. It had a quite large list, containing all the software you usually NEED. Like CCleaner, 7zip/winrar, different free antivira software, and so on. Then you could check all the software you wanted from the site, and it would generate a setup file, with all these programs in it. It was so much easier. But I lost the site, and my puny attempts. Does anyone else experience that he has a higher ping then usual? Mine went from 54 to 105. I also tried to turn of my antivira programm but didnt effect anything. 
Help! I've picked up a virus on my laptop, it's just toshiba satellite but I use it for everything and need rid of this pest. I've only got antivira free and superantispyware free edition. I cannot afford to pay for antivirus software, it's just not an option. I've run scans on both and they're telling me I've got a trojan.dropper/gen. The prgrams both seem unable to control it. Multiple scans and mulitiple move to quarantine then delete have failed to remove this little fucker. Скачайте бесплатный антивирус 360 Total Security, любым удобным для вас способом.
