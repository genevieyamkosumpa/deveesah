I've been having a lot of trouble with my pointing devices on my x230 since disassembling it. I'll post the details below, but the upshot is I keep getting a message saying "You have not restarted your computer since uninstalling the Synaptics Pointing Device driver. Please restart and try again." when I try to install the Synaptics driver despite the fact that I have restarted many, many times. I now have no pointing device installed and it is rather frustrating. This is on Windows 10. After.

I had an x140e and I bought this computer as a replacement which is technically a few years older but man it sure has superior processing power! So far seems like a great computer. Not quite as rugged as the x140e but that's alright. I've installed a fresh copy of windows 7 and am trying to keep the bloatware and unnecessary lenovo software to a minimum.

I recently got myself a yoga 12 (5th gen intel) that runs windows due to being a primary note-taking-machine (ms onenote) which in itself works flawlessly but at times I do want to use it as a notebook albeit be it mostly for browsing reddit. But I have multiple issues with the trackpoint: no true thinkpad scrolling with trackpoint middle button every so often the curser freezes and the trackpoint seems to completly turn itself off (fixes itself then within a few secs) ThinkPad UltraNav Driver - 6,2MB - Freeware - Классический устройство в ThinkPads всегда был trackpoint. С T30 IBM представил UltraNav, сочетание традиционных трекпойнт, в сочетании с программируемая сенсорная панель. Hi, I have a question: I've noticed that the trackpoint on my x230 is much less sensitive and easy to use than the trackpoint on my x201. I have the same settings in control panel: mouse, but the x201 trackpoint simply feels better. Does this have to do with the drivers they have? I've noticed that my x201 uses a "Trackpoint Driver," while my x230 uses a "Synaptics Ultranav Driver." Edit: I'm pretty sure the issue starts with my thinkpad's software or hardware: I connected my X230's keyboard.

Hi For people who aren't die-hard trackpoint clitters, does anyone know if any Thinkpads have adopted the ALPS + MS Precision touchpads or are they still all Synaptics + Ultranav? Is anyone who's used both willing to share what they like/dislike about how each of them performs in their view? A short comparison? Thanks. Обзор.

So. Windows Precision Touchpad is a thing. It is usable , unlike the old Windows touchpad experience. But most Lenovo hardware doesn't have supported hardware - ThinkPads pre-2017 nearly all don't. Which sucks. Now, there is a driver package available online that claims to enable Precision on all Synaptics touchpads. In reality, it works on machines where the OEM didn't play around too much. ThinkPads are different - they have the TrackPoint and associated buttons. So that driver package. · ThinkPad UltraNav Pointing Device Synaptics Pointing Device Driver. Пакет драйверов. Данные драйверы предназначены для работы. Just got a T430 as my first ThinkPad, and overall I love it but the touchpad is giving me some issues. With the latest drivers (19.0.17.140), there is no way to set two- and three-finger taps using the UltraNav settings. The registry editing method described here (https://iampaulh.blogspot.com/2012/06/adding-middle-click-to-synaptics-touch.html), among other places, worked for two finger tap, but not for three finger tap. I did manage to find some version of the drivers (sorry, I forget which. I have been using Linux exclusively for the past few months, but currently need to use Windows 7 x64 for a while. However, after dual booting to Windows I discovered I can't middle click with my trackpoint. I used tpmiddle since day one and it was working correctly - scrolling and middle clicking. I've noticed Windows Update offered an update for UltraNav pointing device, so I upraded. However, now tpmiddle (bot 0.6 and 0.7) show an error message saying `Cannot obtain an API object: 0x8004015.

So I bought a T61 that came with Windows 10 Pro. Seems to work okay except when I swipe from the left edge of the touchpad inward, it goes into task view and it gets really annoying. This is a known feature and online they talk about removing it through the group policy editor (by disabling AllowEdgeSwipes). However, that didn't work. Apparently you should be able to disable it through the touchpad settings, but because the computer is so old that option doesn't exist in the ultranav settings.

I'm installing Windows 10 on a used T420. I went to the Lenovo site and found several drivers and other software that look like they could be useful to install: 8ass82ww Media Card Reader Driver 8avx51ww Smart Card Reader Driver g1f814ww ThinkVantage Fingerprint Software g5dn18ww Thinkpad Video Features (NVIDIA NVS Driver) gggr04ww Synaptics Thinkpad Ultranav Driver LBSSetup Lenovo Service Bridge Setup lscsetup_x64_312003 Lenovo Solution Center sif11ww160 Lenovo system Interface. So, from what I can gather, a kind programmer Gerhard Wiesinger wrote a utility to allow middle-mouse-clicking with the TrackPoint button with the scroll function still enabled. There seems to be two versions of TPMiddle floating around - 0.6 and 0.7 - which somehow works differently. 0.6 works fine on my T480 but somehow 0.7 doesn't work here and also not for a lot of people. I want to look at how they work exactly and try to (or get someone to) improve it, perhaps with more customization. 
Hello, I recently bought a W541 and installed Windows 10 onto it. After installing a bunch of drivers from the Lenovo website, I was still stuck with a problem. Scrolling with the middle TrackPoint button or with two fingers does not work at all. The newest UltraNav driver from Lenovo does not seem to work at all. I don't even have the "Synaptics Device Options" tab in the mouse settings and tried to install all sorts of driver versions, but with no success. The hardware ID for the install. Windows 7 As the titles says, my x220t's Trackpad and trackpoint(and its buttons) have not been working for a few months. when trying using either of them nothing happens. The rest of the keyboard works without issue Things I have tried so far : Enabling trackpad and trackpoint in bios both were already checked, tried disabling them, rebooting, and enabling again, no luck. Also selected the " load setup defaults (https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-X-Series-Laptops/X220-Touchpad-and-. I have a year and a half old lenovo and I have recently stumbled across a lot of videos stating that I can improve my trackpad by forcing precision drivers onto my laptop instead of the standard synaptics drivers. amp#x200B; I decided to give it a go, and using the lenovo drivers linked on basically every tutorial I can get a different driver installed. However, I don't get the precision menu and instead end up with lenovo ultranav drivers (which has none of the benefits that I am looking. Hello all I have been a long time thinkpad user so I feel like I should know how trackpoints behave. I just got a new X1 Carbon gen 6 and it does the follwoing: https://imgur.com/LCVFRNW (https://imgur.com/LCVFRNW) I know trackpoint undergoes calibration intermittently. But it should be very short (\~1 second and usually lt1cm across the screen) Intermittently - 2-3x per day after extensive use, the trackpoint drifts constantly, in 1 direction. it can be Any direction. I have the new X1 Yoga 3rd Gen. When I use the keyboard (in Games, Browser, Office.) the left mousebutton beneath the Trackpoint does not react for about a second or so. I have to press it several times until it's working again. The right mousebutton works always. I use a fresh installation of Windows 10 and all ThinkPad X1 Yoga 3rd Gen drivers from the support.lenovo.com website. (e.g. WinTab Driver for Windows 10 (64-bit), Synaptics UltraNav Driver Windows 10 64-bit and Lenovo Enhanced. I just received my new T470 this week. Everything is pretty good (screen could be better) but the lack of touchpad options is really bugging me. Is there a way to either revert from the "Precision Touchpad" and use the older style Synaptics or UltraNav drivers with all the options? Or possibly add them to the Precision Touchpad in Windows 10? I really miss having two finger tap to middle click and the two finger scroll speed is way too slow/not sensitive enough. Hey everyone, I replaced my trackpad on my T440s with an ALPS 3-button model that I found on eBay. It works fine with the drivers from the E450 on Windows, however every 3 reboots it seems that it has to be reinstalled. My scrolling functionality will break and the UltraNav settings will disappear. I don't think it's an issue with Windows Update installing Synaptics drivers because I've disabled it from doing so under Group Policy. It's frustrating to have to reinstall the drivers every. 
It's been well established that the single button trackpads are awful, but I got a deal on this T540p that I couldn't pass up. So I did what many have done, and I replaced the trackpad with a Three-Button one. This was working fine until a few days ago, when I let Windows update to Build 1709. Now two-finger scrolling is gone and I can't adjust anything because UltraNav settings are missing. It got so frustrating (combined with some unfortunately slow boot speeds) that I reinstalled Windows. Hi all I just recently received my x260 with Windows 10 installed. One thing I've noticed is that the trackpoint is quite a bit slower/heavier than my other thinkpads and thinkpad keyboard. I've already set the sensitivity to highest in the Synaptic UltraNav driver. Is there any hack that allows me to further increase the sensitivity. Hello fellas, So i recently updated my t440s with a 3 Buttons Touchpad from a t450(s). Hardware ID LEN0036. The Issue now is, runnig WIN10, the Gesture for scrolling / zooming doesnt work. Also when i am using the trackpoint, the touchpad is not disabled. I tried several UltraNav Drivers recomended on the web, which should work, none does. I tried the Driver stated here on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/2uw7g3/t440s_and_x240_owners_trackpoint_with_physical/) Hello. Has anybody got precision drivers to work on Thinkpad T430? I watched Dave Lee's video about installing precision drivers top of synaptics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2rfwR-IV-campt=74s. When I install the precision drivers, my pc still has ultranav settings and I cannot change touchpad settings from Windows 10 settings. I really want gestures to work on my Thinkpad. The Synaptics Thinkpad UltraNav driver is where I always go to get my Dragons of Atlantis. edit: This is directly from Lenovo's driver page for a ThinkPad T430s. 
I'm sharing this so that it comes up in searches for anyone like me in the future who was banging their head on this issue. You want n15gx14w.exe released on 2016/10/06. This is listed by Lenovo as Synaptics Pointing Device Driver for Windows 8.1 (64-bit), 7 (64-bit) - ThinkPad 11e (Type 20D9, 20DA), Yoga 11e (Type 20D9, 20DA) (https://support.lenovo.com/cl/en/downloads/ds041497). The direct download link is here (https://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/mobiles/n15gx14w.exe). After. So I did the trackpad swap on my T440p with the T450 trackpad. Of course, I managed to find some older drivers that works 'okay' but not 100% original equipment feel. I believe I have the Synaptics trackpad since I'm able to use this trackpad on a much older Synaptics driver. The best driver I found to work is the n10gx25w  Touchpad navigation is great, the UltraNav buttons work BUT trackpoint scrolling doesn't work on all apps (Opera and Win10 apps). It's getting a bit irritating. I've tried. </p>
